Tracks profile reactions to diary entries.

DiaryReaction {
  id: int;                // Unique identifier (auto-generated)
  diaryId: int;           // Diary being reacted to
  profileId: int;         // Profile who reacted (foreign key to Profiles)
  reactionType: string;   // Reaction type: "like", "love", "laugh", "sad", "angry", "surprised"

### üß† Key Points

* Reaction entities are stored separately per resource type.

* API endpoints use **`react`** and **`unreact`** verbs for adding/removing reactions.

* Example endpoints:

  * `POST /profiles/{username}/diaries/{diaryId}/react` ‚Äî Add reaction to diary
  * `POST /profiles/{username}/diaries/{diaryId}/unreact` ‚Äî Remove reaction from diary
  * `POST /profiles/{username}/diaries/{diaryId}/comments/{commentId}/react` ‚Äî Add reaction to comment
  * `POST /profiles/{username}/diaries/{diaryId}/comments/{commentId}/unreact` ‚Äî Remove reaction from comment
