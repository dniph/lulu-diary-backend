# ⚙️ **Models Documentation**

**Models** represent core data structures that define the shape and relationships of persistent resources in the system. They are typically managed through standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and serve as the foundation for higher-level behaviors and actions.

Each model includes:

* **Field definitions** and relationships (e.g., foreign keys, references to profiles or other models).
* **Purpose** and how it fits into the system (e.g., tracking friendships, storing diary entries, managing comments).
* **Examples** of typical `SELECT *` queries to illustrate usage.

Models are distinct from **actions**, which describe more complex workflows or behavior not strictly tied to CRUD (see **Actions Documentation**).
