### ðŸ§  Business Logic & Example SQL

- Unauthenticated users see only public diaries.
- Authenticated users see public, their own private, and friends-only diaries for users they follow.
- Pagination should be implemented for performance.
- Diaries should be ordered by `createdAt` (most recent first).
